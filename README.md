# Winter is Coming

## 💡 Inspiration

This homecoming season, the world is on the brink of a global pandemic. Homecoming is a long-standing American tradition where colleges and high schools would welcome alumni back to campus and the community. We were excited to be a part of this tradition and to be a part of the global movement to unite the world. We wanted to create a platform for students to connect with each other and to share their experiences. That is why we created Winter is Coming.
