# Winter is Coming

## 💡 Inspiration

This homecoming season, the world is on the brink of a global pandemic. Homecoming is a long-standing American tradition where colleges and high schools would welcome alumni back to campus and the community. We were excited to be a part of this tradition and to be a part of the global movement to unite the world. We wanted to create a platform for students to connect with each other and to share their experiences. That is why we created Winter is Coming.

## 💻 What it does

**Winter is Coming** is a video calling platform that will enable you to -

- **Connect**: Connect with other students in your class and share your experiences.
- **Share**: Share your experiences with other students in your class.
- **Learn**: Learn from other students in your class.

It is a place where you can share your stories, experiences, and experiences with your classmates and friends.

## ⚙️How we built it

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS
- Backend: Django
- Database: CockroachDB
- Linode: hosting and storage
- Authentication: Auth0

## 💾 Use of CockroachDB

- We have used CockroachDB as a primary database because it is an easy-to-use, open-source and indestructible SQL database.

## ☁️ Use of Linode

We utilized Linode for its hosting and storage. Linode is one of the top IaaS providers and is incredibly easy to use and the free Linode credit from MLH for us to learn and build on Linode was the cherry on the cake! Linode is fast, flexible, and reliable, and we truly enjoyed using it.
